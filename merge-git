You want to merge changes from one branch (e.g., feature-branch) into another (e.g., main) and push it to GitHub.

ðŸ§± STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS
1. Clone the repo (if not already)
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
cd repo
If you already have it cloned, just cd into the repo.

2. Fetch all branches and latest change
git fetch --all
3. Switch to the target branch (e.g., main)
git checkout main
4. Make sure your target branch is up to date
git pull origin main
5. Merge the source branch (e.g., feature-branch) into target
git merge feature-branch
If there's no conflict: âœ… Merge is successful.

If there is a conflict, Git will show the conflicted files. You need to:

Open and manually edit the conflicting files

Use git add <file> for each resolved file

Run git commit to complete the merge

6. Push the merged changes to GitHub
git push origin main
ðŸ§ª Example

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main
