To prevent sensitive information such as access keys or credentials from being exposed in a public GitHub repository, you should create a .gitignore
file in your local repository and specify confidential files (e.g., .env) within it. This ensures that Git excludes those files from version control, 
thereby protecting your credentials from being accidentally committed and pushed to GitHub.
