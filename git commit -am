git commit: The command used to create a new commit (a snapshot of changes) in your Git repository.

-a: Automatically stages tracked files that have been modified or deleted (but not new untracked files).

-m "message": Specifies the commit message directly in the command.

git commit -am "message"

# What it does:
It adds all modified and deleted files that are already being tracked by Git, and then commits them with the provided message.

# What it does NOT do:
It does not stage new (untracked) files. For that, you still need to use:

git add newfile.txt

Ex:
git commit -am "Fix bug in login flow"
This:

Automatically stages changes in tracked files.

Commits those changes with the message "Fix bug in login flow".
